# Image recognition

Animation Creation

The animations for the T-shirts are created using After Effects, a powerful motion graphics and visual effects software. The animations are then exported as image sequences in `.png` format, which are loaded into the app. The app uses Apple's AVFoundation framework to play the image sequence as an animation.

### Facial Expression Detection

The app utilizes Apple's ARKit framework to detect the user's facial expressions in real-time. The ARKit framework provides a powerful set of tools for creating augmented reality experiences, including a face tracking API for detecting facial expressions. The app tracks the user's facial expressions and triggers the corresponding animation frames, creating the illusion of the T-shirt responding to the user's expression.

### T-Shirt Design

The T-shirt designs are created using 3D modeling software, such as Blender or Maya. The final design is then exported as a `.usdz` file, which is a file format designed specifically for augmented reality applications. The app uses Apple's RealityKit framework to render the 3D models and animations, and the T-shirt design must be optimized for the app's augmented reality features, with careful consideration given to lighting and surface textures.
