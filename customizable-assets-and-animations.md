# Customizable assets and animations

One of its key features of the Oko Future app is the ability to customize the 3D assets, such as clothing or accessories, by changing textures, animations, colors, and other attributes. The app utilizes Metal, Apple's low-level graphics framework, to render the 3D assets, providing high-performance graphics rendering. The app also uses Metal to create reactive, real-time animations that respond to the user's movements, providing an engaging and dynamic experience.
