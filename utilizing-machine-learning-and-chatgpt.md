# Utilizing machine learning and chatGPT

### ChatGPT avatar

The app integrates with ChatGPT, an advanced language processing model developed by OpenAI. The integration allows the digital avatar to interpret the user's input and provide intelligent and engaging responses. The app uses Apple's Natural Language framework to process the user's input and send it to ChatGPT for interpretation. The response from ChatGPT is then displayed by the digital avatar in real-time.

### Implementation

\
The digital avatar with ChatGPT integration is implemented using a combination of 3D modeling software, keyframe animation, inverse kinematics, and natural language processing. The avatar is created using 3D modeling software, and animated using keyframe animation and inverse kinematics. The app uses Apple's Natural Language framework and Vision framework to process the user's input, which is then sent to ChatGPT for interpretation. The response from ChatGPT is then displayed by the digital avatar in real-time.
